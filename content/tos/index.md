# The "Don't sue me" disclaimer
This service is provided as-is with no warranty, express or implied. 
RADUGA is under no legal obligation to provide you with service, or keep the service it provides consistent. 
Don't fucking sue me over shit I don't have an obligation to provide, basically.

# How to not get banned
You may be banned for the following reasons:

- Conducting any activity that breaks the laws in which RADUGA is governed
- Encouraging others to break RADUGA's rules or the law using RADUGA
- Under special or exigent circumstances I may ban you for something not listed here. I will probably warn you first.

# Privacy
RADUGA has a robust plain-language [Privacy Policy](/privacy) that details what information is collected and how it is used.
By registering for RADUGA, you are giving your consent to your data being collected as detailed there.

# Backups
I do not do backups. Do backups yourself. If a meteor hits a data center, everything is gone.
